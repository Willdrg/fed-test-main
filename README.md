# Zemoga TRAINEE Front End Test

To run the code is necessary to use a Live server. 

Visual Studio Code has one included. 

I had some troubles bringing the info from the data.json but searching trough Google i find that the solution was running a live server. 

The Media Querys for laptop will appear for screens with more than 1440 px

I hope you guys enjoy the project as i did while coding it!!
